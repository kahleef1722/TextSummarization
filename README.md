# TextSummarization
This project implements text summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. It applies preprocessing, tokenization, word frequency analysis, and sentence scoring to generate concise summaries from longer texts. The goal of this project is to demonstrate extractive summarization using NLTK in a simple and effective way.
